## What To See

### Project description

The project's goal was to build a simple and clear website for users who would like to find the best places to see in a given city. It should work just like this: you give me the name of a city and in return, I give you a list of places of interest situated there.

### Development

I have designed the website with the aid of a free version of Adobe XD. When blueprints were ready, I started to code in Visual Studio Code. I have decided to use React.js framework because I had wanted to improve my comprehension of this technology. To get necessary data about places of interest, my website communicates with Sygic Travel API.

### Used tools

Adobe XD, HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Sygic Travel API
